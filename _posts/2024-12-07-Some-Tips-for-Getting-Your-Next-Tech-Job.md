## Some Tips for Getting Your Next Tech Job

Recently, I switched jobs. Due to the rapid evolution of technology and increased competition, the job search process has significantly changed in the last few years. In this post, I will share some do's and don'ts of job searching that I learned during my own journey.

## My tips to win üòÉ

1. **Narrow down your applications:** Just because there are many job postings out there‚Äîor perhaps not enough jobs matching your experience‚Äîwhatever the situation, **it's crucial to focus your applications on roles that genuinely interest you and align with your background.** Trust me, if you are experienced in Microsoft frameworks and apply for a Linux specialty role, chances are they won‚Äôt call you. Even if they do, it will likely be a waste of your time and energy. Hiring managers generally prefer candidates with directly relevant experience.
(Note: This doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt change tracks! If you‚Äôve thoroughly prepared for a new field or completed impressive personal projects, you‚Äôre more than encouraged to pivot.)  

2. **Keep your resume to the point:** Remove unnecessary information from your resume. For example, if you have more than five years of experience, no one cares about your undergraduate thesis. If you‚Äôre applying for a manager position, it rarely matters if you analyzed database deadlocks using memory dumps. If you have both a Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science, listing only the Master‚Äôs degree is sufficient.
Including irrelevant details can harm your chances‚Äîyour resume may fail AI screening, and even if it passes, recruiters might dismiss it for being overloaded with information. Think of why we love Google‚Äôs interface: simplicity!

3. **Use AI to tailor your resume:** Use ChatGPT or another AI tool to customize your resume for each job application. AI tools excel at identifying key skills required for a role. However, be cautious‚ÄîAI might add skills you don‚Äôt actually possess üòä, so always double-check the output. Similarly, you can use ChatGPT to draft tailored cover letters.

4. **Practise speaking with an AI tool:** ChatGPT has an excellent feature where you can simulate a job interview. Start by asking it a question, then give your answer, and it will provide feedback. This helps improve speaking skills and reduces interview anxiety.

5. **Review Amazon's leadership principles:** [Amazon's leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles) are fantastic guidelines to follow‚Äînot just for Amazon interviews, but for any job. Study them thoroughly and relate them to your past experiences. During your interview, demonstrate how you‚Äôve lived by these principles. (*You don‚Äôt need to mention the principles explicitly but show through examples how you embody them.*)

6. **Prepare for behavioral questions based on the company and role:** Technical professionals often underestimate the importance of behavioral questions, but they can be critical. Prepare a document with 15 of your most challenging achievements, covering areas like back-end, front-end, and databases. Write 1‚Äì2 pages on each and review them to remember key details. When you will face the behavioral questions, try to relate your answer to one of your achievements.   
Common questions that you will face are like - tell me the proudest moment of your career, tell me a time when you had to learn a new skill and what was the outcome, tell me about a time when you had to go beyond your regular responsibility, tell me time when you handled a project from beginning to end (or for over a few months), tell me about a time when you could not deliver what the customer asked and how did you handle that situation, tell me about a time when you resolved a difficult problem with an easy solution, tell me a time when you had to explain a technical problem to a non-technical group of people, tell me about a time when you had to deal with a very frustrated customer, tell us a time when someone criticized you and how you reacted, tell us about a time when you had to provide a critical feedback - how did you do that? etc.   
When answering behavioral questions, **Align your responses with the company's mission and work culture.** Your answers for a startup should differ from those for an enterprise. **Aim to subtly incorporate Amazon's leadership principles into your responses.** Focus on demonstrating how your actions and decisions align with these principles, using real-life examples to illustrate your alignment naturally and effectively.


7. **Technical preparation should be done pro-actively:** Based on your focused area of job, start preparing pro-actively. Read a few job descriptions. Check what is typically asked for your role. Review those materials. There are plenty of websites that can help you preparing such as [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/) and many more.   


8. **Earn certifications and share your work on Github**: Earn certifications if possible. I found a drastic difference of getting recruiter attention before and after I completed my certifications. Share your projects on GitHub, and if possible, contribute to open-source projects. Even contributing to documentation is valuable! There are many guidelines on the internet about them. 

9. **Take recruiter interview seriously:** Many candidates think, *"Recruiter interviews are easy; there's no way I can fail."* Absolutely wrong! Statistically, you are more likely to fail a recruiter interview than a technical one. To succeed, prepare thoroughly for behavioral questions and keep your answers concise. Never spend more than two minutes answering a question‚Äîrecruiters often have limited time (e.g., 30 minutes) and need to cover 10 to 15 questions.
Always focus on your expertise and how you‚Äôre the perfect fit for the role, even if the question doesn‚Äôt seem directly related. For instance, if the recruiter asks, ‚ÄúTell me about your journey in life,‚Äù don‚Äôt delve into childhood or school memories. Instead, focus on the last 5‚Äì7 years and highlight how your skills align with the role. Time is precious!   
Specially prepare for the common questions like - What makese you interested in working for this company? Why are you interested in this role? Why do you think you are a good fit for this job? Why are you leaving your current job?  Tell me about yourself. To answer these questions effectively, read the company‚Äôs mission and the role description. Align your past experience with the company‚Äôs goals and the responsibilities of the role. Genuinely ask yourself: *How will working for this company and in this role positively impact the lives of others?*       
When replying, avoid anything negative. For example, don‚Äôt say, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm switching jobs because my current company pays too little."* üòÉ Instead, frame your response positively, such as: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a role with more exciting challenges.‚Äù*  
If a recruiter says something like, *‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no right or wrong answer to this question‚Äù* or *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not evaluating your response of this question; we‚Äôre just checking your thought process,‚Äù* be extra cautious. These are often the **most critical** questions of the interview. Recruiters might say this to make you feel relaxed, but being too casual can lead to mistakes. From my experience, every time I gave a casual response to such a question, I failed to progress to the next round.  
One more thing to keep in mind: recruiters (and even hiring managers) sometimes include puzzles in the interview process. Whether puzzles should be part of interviews is debatable üòä, but it‚Äôs always a good idea to review a few to sharpen your puzzle-solving skills.      


10. **Highlight 2-3 key skills during technical interviews**: During the technical interview you will be asked technical questions related to the role. But, during this time, try to emphasize that you have strong skills in 2-3 areas. When you mention about these 2-3 areas, speak with confidence. Present challenging case studies from your past. Be prepared to go deep in these 2-3 areas. For example, you might highlight your proficiency in C# and system design or JavaScript and React.

Following these tips will increase your chances of landing your dream job. I wish you the best of luck in your next career move! üéâ
