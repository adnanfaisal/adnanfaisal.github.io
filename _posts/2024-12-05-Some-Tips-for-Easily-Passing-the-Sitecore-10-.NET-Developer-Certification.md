## Some tips for easily passing the Sitecore 10 .NET Developer Certification

Last month I passed Sitecore 10 .NET Developer Certification Exam. Hurray! To be able to pass the exam, some web development experience with Sitecore is required.  In this post I will share some do's and don't for passing this certification like a charm!

## My tips to win üòÉ

1. There is an official course (titled *‚ÄúXM/XP 10 For .NET Developers‚Äù*) in the *Sitecore Learning Portal*. If you have some familiarity with Sitecore, you won‚Äôt find this learning path to be the best use of your time. I stopped doing the course after a few hours. To me it felt like it is more suitable for ther marketers.     

2. Follow the **Official Study Guide** from the Sitecore learning portal. It has a bunch of links. Just quickly review them. (No need to memorize everything you find there üòä) 

3. Reading and remembering everything from the Study guide is impossible (unless you are super passionate üòÇ). How much should you study on each competency area? Navan has done an excellent job by outlining the required depths for each competency area and covering the most frequently asked questions in his [Sitecore 10 Developer Crash Course found on youtube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kQ8o9ODoQM&t=127s). 
If you only follow Navan‚Äôs 1-hour course, you should be already able to answer already 50%-60% of the questions. However, I found the exam is little different in some competency area than what Navan mentioned in his video (probably because the exam changed a little bit since the video was recorded). My next points are about those differences. 

4. The video does not put emphasis on versioning and language fallback. But, they ask 4-5 questions on this competency area. One question could be - *How can you show different item names in different language versions in Sitecore?* You can read from [here](https://www.logicalfeed.com/posts/1159/versioned-vs-shared-vs-unversioned-fields-in-sitecore) or [here]( 
https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/users/100/sitecore-experience-platform/rename-an-item-or-page.html).

5. The questions related to CLI were even simpler than what Navan's video covered.

6. Surprisingly, I don't remember facing any question related to ASP .NET Core Rendering SDK or Headless development.

7. Make sure you try installing Sitecore in Docker container. Keeping the experience fresh in memory will help with some of the questions. 

8. There were 3-4 questions related to *Personalization* including rule set. [Read about them thoroughly](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/users/latest/sitecore-experience-platform/personalization.html).

9. I was not expecting any questions related to Sitecore Analytics. But in the exam, there were 3-4 questions related to xDB. Try to understand the different [services and roles in Sitecore Analytics](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/latest/platform-administration-and-architecture/experience-platform-application-roles.html). There was even a deeper question like how to deploy a custom model to xConnect. (The answer is [here](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/latest/sitecore-experience-platform/deploy-a-custom-model.html).)
10. Navan's video did not cover Solr. But, in the exam there were 4-5 questions from Solr. Understand the config file Sitecore.ContentSearch.Solr.DefaultIndexConfiguration.config. Know what are the [supported IQueryable methods](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/latest/sitecore-experience-manager/search-indexes-using-linq-to-sitecore.html). 

After you've studied the above materials, it is time to test your knowledge with some model exams! üòé 

## Sample Exam Questions
