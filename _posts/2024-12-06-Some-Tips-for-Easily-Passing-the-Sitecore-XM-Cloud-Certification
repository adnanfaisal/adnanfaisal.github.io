## Some tips for easily passing the Sitecore XM Cloud Certification

Last month I passed Sitecore XM Cloud Certification Exam. Hurray! If you are already a Sitecore Certified .NET Developer, this exam should not be hard for you. A preparation of 2-4 days should be enough. In this post I will share some do's and don't for passing this certification like a charm!

## My tips to win ðŸ˜ƒ

1. **Understand the Difficulty:** The material for this exam is harder compared to the Sitecore 10 .NET Developer Certification Exam, but the actual test is much easier! I was able to score 98% ðŸ˜Ž by following the resources below.    

2. **Use the Official Study Guide:** Follow the *Official Study Guide* from the Sitecore Learning Portal. It contains a lot of linksâ€”review them thoroughly. (You donâ€™t need to memorize everything, but having a good understanding is key.)

3. **Navan's Crash Course:** If I recommend you to watch only one video for preparation - it is once again [Navan's crash course](https://youtu.be/qeF8aABts40?si=3_OUZRO1GASiDUyv)! His video is a lifesaver.

4. **Adjust Expectations:** Unlike Navanâ€™s Sitecore 10 .NET crash course, his XM Cloud crash course delves deeper into many topics. However, the actual exam is much easier than what he covers. If you donâ€™t understand some parts of the video, feel free to skip them ðŸ˜Š (at least for the exam).

5. **Focus on Key Slides:** Pay special attention to the slides titled *Important Points* in Navanâ€™s video. Make sure you understand these slides thoroughly â€” **they are the most important for the exam!**

6. **Key Topics to Study:** While all topics in the *Study Guide* are important, focus particularly on: Deploy app and Deployment log, Publishing pipeline for Experience Edge, REST API, Organization, Components (how to use them), Pages, common GraphQL query, and WebHooks. Remember that, some topics from the Sitecore .NET Developer Certificate Exam will be repeated, specially the questions related to CLI, Serialization, Security and Templates.

7. **Watch Additional Videos:** Watch the **XM Cloud Certification Prep** playlist by [My Sitecore Diaries](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLt519PJr4jF_WIJ3lTLpS4tQQ_j6oKHdp). At the time of writing, this playlist contains five short videos, which are very helpful for clarifying key concepts.

8. **Hands-on Practice:** If you have admin or owner permissions for the *Sitecore Cloud Portal*, spend some time exploring it. For example, deploy a new project or experiment with Pages. If you donâ€™t have such permissions, you can watch videos like this [XM Cloud Portal Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn5BPpG02yI).

There are plenty of free sample questions available online, and many of them are repeated in the actual exam! ðŸ‘¼ After reviewing the above materials, practicing these questions will surely help you ace the test:
