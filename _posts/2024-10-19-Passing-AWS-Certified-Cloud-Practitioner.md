## Passing AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner in a week

Recently I passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam. It took me less than 10 days to prepare and pass the exam. I studied few hours everyday after my office. 
I would say it is an excellent exam if you want to familiarize yourself with the most important AWS services. It will work as a foundation for your other AWS certifications. 

I passed only using the following free materials. No need to buy any expensive course! Here goes what I used:
1. **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials:** This awesome free course from Amazon covers 70%-80% materials of the exam. This course is very well designed and presented! [Link](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/134/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials)
2. **Exam questions**: The reddit page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/15sp4rn/i_made_450_practice_questions_for_aws_cloud/) has a compilation of ~500 questions from the exam.
3. I completed only about 150 questions from the booklet yet in the real exam there were 4-5 questions that I found common! Thanks to Cathal McGuinness for his hard work! 
5. **AWS Cloud Quest**: This free game will give you a chance to put your knowledge into practise. Lab exercises in a game-setting mode! Fun and useful.
   It's OK even if you can complete only few of the exercises. [Link](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/11458/aws-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner)
7. **WhitePapers**: Try to quickly review the [*AWS Well-Architectured Framework*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)
8. and [*AWS Cloud Adoption Framework*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/overview-aws-cloud-adoption-framework/overview-aws-cloud-adoption-framework.pdf).
9. The examiner likes to ask questions about these two topics! The **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials:** course does not cover these topics in detail. 
10.
